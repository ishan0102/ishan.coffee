- CLI tool that takes an image and sticks it on the web as a permalink. Currently copy images into GitHub and steal the link that it generates.
- Reresume: upload a resume and a job description link and get a rewritten resume tailored to the job.
- Convert research papers to running code automatically, or at least a repo scaffold.
- Match post writers across the web using stylometry.
- Receipt extraction for splitting meals and groceries. Just take a picture of what you ate or purchased and have an LLM do the math. Could be possible when the GPT-V API drops. Fuyu-8B might work as well.
- Build a knowledge graph of code blocks with an entire repository. There can be an agent that can operate on this graph asynchronously. I believe [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) is working on something like this.
- Interview prep using ChatGPT + voice mode.
- Write a blog post evangelizing VS Code.
- Embed your entire Twitter/Discord/etc and make connections from your likes, followers, etc.
- Display some of the best pieces of writing on the Internet in a common place, with beautiful styling. For example all of the Paul Graham essays, some Twitter posts, Ted Chiang essays like *Understand* that only exist on old web archives.
- Dscan: scan through your data and "swipe left/right" on good/bad examples to manually create a training set.

- Convert images to LaTeX, could be useful for converting complicated graphs or diagrams.
- Automatically teach yourself using short form videos like the subway surfer TikToks. Can query content from anywhere - reddit, twitter etc. Need to make a more general data querying tool that I can use for things.
- Summarize any subreddit with LLMs by querying the RSS.
- Rebuild popular products like Postman as free, open-source tools.
- An AR tool that lets you query references you like to make. Imagining something like Family Guy cutaways, effectively querying your memories.
- A way to modify a calendar state by directly altering the JSON version with an LLM.
- Embed solutions to LeetCode problems to compare similarity.
- A language model to translate mixed languages like Chinglish or Hinglish.
- AB testing for agentic web browsing.
- Automatically create YouTube shorts/TikToks from subreddits.
- Solve the issue where you have a ton of Jupyter notebooks all with slightly different variations of the same pre-processing code.
- A little guy who organizes and cleans up your codebase while you're not using your computer.
- Link entire codebases together graphically and automatically and allow users to parse through the function calls in a spatial UI – "spatial coding".
- Map coding error messages to their solutions to build up a repository of personal debugging tricks automatically.
- GPT vision tools:
	- Better autonomous web browsing
	- Receipt extraction
	- Math homework helper
	- Image to LaTeX converter
	- Calorie counter
	- Recipe generator from ingredients
	- Diagram generator from whiteboard
	- Excel analyzer
	- Detect fake vs. real sneakers
	- Structure-anything: convert anything to structured data
	- An "anything API" since it can see the whole web
- *Actually good* dev-tools for things like base64 conversion, OpenAI token counting, etc. Good for LLM devs and regular devs alike.
- Better interface for constant web-scraping using [this](https://github.com/simonw/ca-fires-history/blob/main/.github/workflows/scrape.yml).
- Convert an MIT course into useful lecture notes. Should add a sliding scale that lets you modify the difficulty, can do this by pre-generating content for different education levels. [1](https://twitter.com/ocolegro/status/1707823106767651239?s=46&t=4LxBxS_eu8BphijSvNj7HA)
- Compressing thought and expanding it again is like noising and denoising in diffusion models.
- Continuously summarize HN, Reddit, etc. and generate podcast episodes, similar to [ScribePod](https://github.com/yacineMTB/scribepod).
