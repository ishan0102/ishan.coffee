- CLI tool that takes an image and sticks it on the web as a permalink. Currently copy images into GitHub and steal the link that it generates.
- Reresume: upload a resume and a job description link and get a rewritten resume tailored to the job.
- Convert research papers to running code automatically, or at least a repo scaffold.
- Match post writers across the web using stylometry.
- Receipt extraction for splitting meals and groceries. Just take a picture of what you ate or purchased and have an LLM do the math. Could be possible when the GPT-V API drops. Fuyu-8B might work as well.
- Build a knowledge graph of code blocks with an entire repository. There can be an agent that can operate on this graph asynchronously. I believe [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) is working on something like this.
- Interview prep using ChatGPT + voice mode.
- Write a blog post evangelizing VS Code.
- Embed your entire Twitter/Discord/etc and make connections from your likes, followers, etc.
- Display some of the best pieces of writing on the Internet in a common place, with beautiful styling. For example all of the Paul Graham essays, some Twitter posts, Ted Chiang essays like *Understand* that only exist on old web archives.
- Dscan: scan through your data and "swipe left/right" on good/bad examples to manually create a training set. Inspired by [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/14vnfh2/my_experience_on_starting_with_fine_tuning_llms/), [2](https://twitter.com/yacinemtb/status/1679466332964761600?s=46&t=4LxBxS_eu8BphijSvNj7HA).
- Convert images to LaTeX, could be useful for converting complicated graphs or diagrams.
- Automatically teach yourself using short form videos like the subway surfer tiktoks. Can query content from anywhere - reddit, twitter etc. Need to make a more general data querying tool that I can use for things.
- Summarize any subreddit with LLMs by querying the RSS.
