Specs for my new computer:
- CPU: Intel i7 14700K ($260)
- Motherboard: MSI Z790-P Pro ($170)
- GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 FE 24GB ($2000)
- RAM: G.Skill 2x16GB DDR5 ($67)
- SSD: Samsung 2TB NVME ($110)
- Power Supply: EVGA 1600W ATX ($360)
- Case: Lian Li EVO XL ($235)
- Fans: Be Quiet Dark Rock Pro 4 ($110)

Total cost came out to be $3,312, which is pretty decent for a deep learning build considering my fully specced-out M1 MacBook Pro costs around the same. On a preliminary CPU test, it seems like this build is around twice as fast as my mac. I got the GPU from StockX, and everything else from Micro Center.
