> Over winter break last year, I tried learning everything I could about AWS. I took a bunch of notes and decided to compile them all here. While AWS can feel overwhelming, I think it's a great tool to know for personal projects because of how cheap, fast, and battle-tested services like S3, Lambda, and Dynamo are. I hope this helps!

## Foundations of Cloud Computing

### Overview
- **Original whitepaper:** https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-overview/aws-overview.pdf
- **Cloud Computing:** delivery of computing services over the internet (compute, networking, storage, analytics, development, security, databases)
- **Virtual Machine:** virtualization divides physical hardware (server) into smaller units
- usage is on a meter, pay for what you use

### Advantages
- deploy globally with regional data centers
- stop spending money running/maintaining data centers
- economies of scale through volume discounts
- increase speed and agility for quicker development
- capacity is scaled to demand
- variable expense model

### Cloud Terminology
- **High Availability:** outages are rare
- **Elasticity:** grow and shrink based on demand
- **Agility:** faster speed to market
- **Durability:** long-term data protection
- **capital expenditures:** fixed assets, operating expenses:** day-to-day operations

### Cloud Computing Models
- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** fundamental building blocks
- **Software as a Service (SaaS):** an entire app on demand
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** develop software with web-based tools

### Cloud Deployment Models
- **Private Cloud:** on premises, no cloud computing advantages
- **Public Cloud:** AWS advantages
- **Hybrid Cloud:** separate sensitive data from infra hosting (public + private)

### Global Infrastructure
- **Region:** grouped by geographic locations for enhanced speed
   - contains multiple AZs
   - fully independent and isolated, resources are specific to regions
- **Availability Zones (AZ):** one or more physically separated data centers with redundant power, networking, connectivity, housing
   - connected through low-latency links
   - fault tolerant
   - high availability
- **Edge Locations:** CDN to cache content for fast delivery to users with CloudFront

### AWS Account
- **AWS Management Console:** access AWS account and manage apps from your browser
- **Root User:** can do everything, protect with MFA
