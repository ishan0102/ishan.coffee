A luck surface is the tangible area in which you could get “lucky”. You need to be picking orthogonal vectors so that when you get hits they multiply. Applying to job + referral is one magnitude greater than without, add another magnitude for having a coffee chat. Ultimately people who struggle with rejection often have a surface area of a line, people with opportunities enter 4 dimensions or more.
