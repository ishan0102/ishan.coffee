Transformers have been all the rage in the NLP community ever since [GPT-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3) was released and have recently become more well-known to the public after [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) was released. I'm going to keep track of my favorite ways to learn about the Transformer architecture here.
