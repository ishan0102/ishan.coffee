I'm [Ishan](https://ishanshah.me). I'll mainly write notes here about machine learning, distributed systems, and things I'm building. You can browse on the left, explore the graph on the right, or search the whole site with `âŒ˜+K`.

Notes are in one of three states:
- [[seed|Seed]]: brief ideas
- [[sapling|Sapling]]: fully-formed thoughts
- [[evergreen|Evergreen]]: permanent, constantly growing

I'm currently working through the [[MLIB Practice Problems|Machine Learning Interviews Book]]. Any of the [[evergreen|Evergreen]] notes like [[ML Links]], [[SSH Scripts]], or [[Books]] can be useful starting points for anyone looking to hack around or learn something new. Enjoy!
