I'm [Ishan](https://ishanshah.me). I'll mainly write notes here about machine learning, distributed systems, and things I'm building. You can browse on the left, explore the graph on the right, or search the whole site with `âŒ˜+K`.

Notes are in one of three states:
- [Seed](seed): brief ideas
- [Sapling](sapling): fully-formed thoughts
- [Evergreen](evergreen): permanent, constantly growing
